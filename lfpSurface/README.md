A simple standalone Matlab GUI for estimating the brain surface using SpikeGLX LFP data

Run demo
1. Run demo.m, select demo.lf.bin (or any LFP raw data)
2. The scripts will suggest the brain surface (black dashed line) by looking at LFP power and correlation matrix.
3. Click on any plot to set user-defined surface (red solid line). Press the Save button to write to file.
